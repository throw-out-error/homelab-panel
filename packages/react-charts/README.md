# @flowtr/react-charts

A react chart.js wrapper that pulls data from an api and wraps the data with a selection of chart utlities (eg. the date range).

## Chart Wrappers

### Date Range

This chart is similar to Grafana's chart as it has a date range picker to select the range in time of the data. In the future I might add more storage options but for now it will store the existing chart data in local/session storage so that you can reload the page and it won't reset.
